The Grocery Store mobile application is designed for a vegetable store, complete with its own control panel. The app utilizes the Provider state management system. Users can log in using their email and password, or through their Google account. Alternatively, they have the option to log in as a visitor, though with limited functionalities.
Once logged in, users are presented with two sections. The first section displays all the available products, while the second section shows products with ongoing discounts. Visitors, however, are restricted from performing any actions beyond browsing these sections.
Logged-in users can enjoy various features, such as adding products to their shopping cart or preferences list. They can also search for specific products by their names. Additionally, the app offers a dark mode for user convenience. Should users forget their passwords, they can initiate a password reset via email.
Furthermore, users can access their browsing history to see the last products they viewed. Additionally, they have the option to review their purchase history to keep track of past transactions.
The control panel of the application boasts a simple and user-friendly design. Admins can view all products, add new ones, or modify existing entries. Furthermore, they have access to a comprehensive overview of all orders placed through the app.
